Industrial Engineering Project 2 of 2
1. Given the annual production capacity of the Adani
Mundra Solar panel plant, assume with justifications
a. Percentage production of 60 cell panels
b. Percentage production of 72 cell panels
c. Percentage production of bi-facial panels and
d. Percentage production of 96 cell panels
e. Distribution between c-Si and p-Si for a) b) c) & d)
f. Number produced under a) b) c) & d) for c-Si and
p-Si. Beware that some of these may be zero
2. Using the above assumptions, calculate
a. Number of cells used per year
b. Number of ingots used per year
c. Amount of EVA sheets used per year
d. Amount of Glass used per year
e. Amount of Tedlar used per year and
f. Amount of Aluminium used per year
3. Determine and/or assume Indian solar panel
consumption pattern by month and hence chart the
demand for each item in 2 above for one year.
4. Using appropriate numbers for holding cost ‘h’ and
setup cost ‘A,’ develop the MRP chart for the plant.
Use one month as the base unit.
5. Use the Wagner-Whitin model to optimize the total
annual setup and holding costs.
